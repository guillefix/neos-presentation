      readme: "\n# API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp\n\n###    User stories:\n1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.\n2. The form file input field  has the \"name\" attribute set to \"upfile\". We rely on this in testing.\n3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response\n\n### Usage :\n* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.\n\n### Hint:\n* To handle the file uploading you should use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.\n"
